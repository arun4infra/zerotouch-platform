# Invalid Test Document

## Overview

This document has several validation errors for testing purposes.

## Configuration Parameters

This section contains prose instead of a table, which violates the No-Fluff policy. 
The configuration parameters should be documented in a structured table format. 
This is a long paragraph that explains things in narrative form, which is not allowed 
in this section according to our documentation standards.

Here's another paragraph with more prose. We want to ensure that the prose detection 
script catches these violations and reports them correctly.
